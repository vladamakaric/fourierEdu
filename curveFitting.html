<h1>Curve fitting</h1>
Any integrable function can be represented by an infinite Fourier series. 
The tail off the sum can usually be cut off with reasonable loss off accuracy 
because the magnitude of the higher frequency harmonics diminishes.
Below the user can draw any function and approximate it by a finite Fourier series.
The coefficients are calculated using a variant of the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithm.
The FFT is an algorithm for calculating coefficients for the DFT (discrete Fourier transform)
which is a transformation of a discrete data set into a sum of sinusoids.
In this case the discrete data is the discretized (sampled) version of the function drawn by the user.

After you draw the function you can choose whether you want to approximate
it to a given accuracy, given by a maximum mean squared error. Alternatively you
can choose the number of shifted sinusoids harmonics in the sum.

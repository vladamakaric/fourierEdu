	This is a simple introduction to the concept of Fourier series of periodic functions.
	The tutorial is not mathematically rigorous, rather it aims to be 
	an intuitive starting point. Geometric analogies are used whenever appropriate. 
	It informally uses concepts such as infinite dimensional vector spaces and orthogonality. 
	The material is supplemented with interactive widgets.

	This tutorial only deals with periodic functions. Aperiodic functions can also be analysed with Fourier analysis,
	with various Fourier transforms.

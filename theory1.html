<h1>Periodic functions</h1>

A function \(f(x)\) is periodic if a constant \(T\) exists such that for all \(x\):

The smallest such \(T\) is called the fundamental period \(T_1\).
The fundamental  frequency \(f_1\) is defined as
the reciprocal of \(T_1\)

$$f_1 = \frac{1}{T_1}$$

A harmonic of the function \(f(x)\) is every function \(g(x)\)
with a fundamental frequency that is an
integer multiple of \(T\), \( f(2x), f(3x), \ldots, f(nx) \). 
Every harmonic is also periodic with the period \(T\). 

$$f(nx) = f(n(x + T)) = f(nx + nT)$$

Shifting a function does not effect its periodicity. 

$$
f(x + \phi) = f(x + \phi + T)
$$

<h1>Fourier series</h1>
The idea of Fourier series is that every periodic function \( f \)
with a base frequency of \(f_1\) can be decomposed into a sum
of sinusoidals with integer multiples of that frequency
and variable phase and magnitude.

$$
f(t) = A_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \sin(2\pi f_nt + \phi_n)  
$$

Where $ f_n = n f_1 $.

An alternative form of the sum is of non shifted sines and cosines,
because of the addition formula for sines. 

\begin{align}
&A_n\sin(2\pi f_nt + \phi_n) \\ & = A_n\cos(\phi_n) \sin(2\pi f_nt) + 
							A_n\sin(\phi_n) \cos(2\pi f_nt) \\
							& = S_n \sin(2\pi f_nt) + C_n \cos(2\pi f_nt)
\end{align}

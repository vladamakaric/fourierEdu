<h1>Vector space</h1>
Fourier series can be thought of as an infinite dimensional vector space,
where the basis are sinusoid harmonics. An inner product in the vector space of
functions is defined analogously to its finite dimensional counterpart.

$$
	\langle f,g \rangle=\int f(x)g(x)dx 
$$

The analogy is clear when the integral is approximated as a finite sum of
products of sampled values of the two functions.

In the case of Fourier series, because we are only interested in functions with a period of $T$,
the inner product is defined as

$$
	\langle f,g \rangle= \int_0^T f(x)g(x)dx 
$$

<h2>Orthogonality</h2>
Because functions of interest are periodic with period $T$, so are the sines and cosines constituting the
basis (otherwise their sum wouldn't be periodic with period $T$). 

\[
	\sin\left(n\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right), \ \cos\left(n\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right), \ n \in \{0,1,2,\ldots\}
\]

Sine and cosine harmonics form a basis because they are orthogonal. The notion of orthogonality is
"adopted" by analogy from finite dimensional vector spaces, i.e. inner product of zero. 

For simplicity let $T= 2\pi$.

\begin{align}
	\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(nx)\cos(mx)dx & = 0, \ m,n = \{0,1,2,\ldots\} \\
	\int_0^{2\pi} \cos(nx)\cos(mx)dx & = 0, \ m,n = \{1,2,\ldots\}, \ m\neq n \\
	\int_0^{2\pi} \sin(nx)\sin(mx)dx & = 0, \ m,n = \{1,2,\ldots\}, \ m\neq n
\end{align}

Another function that also constitutes the basis is the constant function $1$. And is also orthogonal to the
other basis components:

\begin{align}
	\int_0^{2\pi} 1\sin(nx)dx & = 0, \ n = \{1,2,\ldots\} \\
	\int_0^{2\pi} 1\cos(nx)dx & = 0, \ n = \{1,2,\ldots\}
\end{align}

<h2>Calculating coefficients</h2>
The Fourier series is defined as in the introductory chapter, (For simplicity, let $T=2\pi$)

\begin{equation} 
	f(t) = A_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}S_n \sin(nt) + C_n \cos(nt)
\end{equation}

The coefficients $A_0, S_n$ and $C_n$ are projections of $f(t)$ onto the basis functions $1, \ \sin(nt)$ and $\cos(nt)$.
Projection of a function $p(x)$ onto $q(x)$ is calculated analogously to finite dimensional vectors

\[
	\text{proj}_{q(x)}(p(x)) = \frac{\langle p, q\rangle}{\left\lVert q \right\rVert}\frac{q}{\left\lVert q \right\rVert} = 
	q\underbrace{\frac{\langle p, q\rangle}{\langle q, q\rangle}}_{Coeff.}
\]

Substituting the basis components for $q$ and $f(t)$ for $p$, the coefficients can be calculated as follows

\begin{align}
	A_0 & = \frac{\langle f(t), 1\rangle}{\langle 1, 1\rangle} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^{T} f(t) dt \\
	C_n & = \frac{\langle f(t), \cos\left(n\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right)\rangle}{\left\lVert\cos\left(n\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right)\right\rVert^2} =
	\frac{2}{T}\int_0^{T} f(t)\cos\left(n\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right) dt \\ 
	S_n & = \frac{\langle f(t), \sin\left(n\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right)\rangle}{\left\lVert\sin\left(n\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right)\right\rVert^2} =
	\frac{2}{T}\int_0^{T} f(t)\sin\left(n\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right) dt 
\end{align}
